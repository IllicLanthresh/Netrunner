# Netrunner
This is the repository for a new project I started and inted to put time on to make a netrunner game in 3d using the Unity 3D engine. 

I don't intend to 'copy' jinteki.net, I just thought it would be great to make a hearthstone looking like game, multiplatform based on netrunner. At the moment I'm using the NetrunnerDB api.

# The Workflow

 Basically, this: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
 
# Add this Git post-merge hook to the /.git/hooks/ folder: https://github.com/strich/git-dir-cleaner-for-unity3d
